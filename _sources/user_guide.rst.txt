You can either use BEaTmap's "envelope" function that will automatically
execute the whole process of a BET analysis and returns the results in form 
of informative plots and tables, or you can call the individual functions
yourself. The latter is useful if you want more control over the process
and possibly want to use the results for further analysis.

If you prefer to go through this guide in the IPython notebook format,
there's on in the GitHub repository. Click
