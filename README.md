Obtaining surface area of a porous sample from the interpretation of gas adsorption isotherms is very widely done using the theory developed by Bennett, Emmett and Tennent in the 1950s.  The BET (or BEaT) theory is so commonly place that the acronym has is synonymous with surface area.  

The BET theory was derived with several assumptions, and these must be met for the predicted surface area to be valid.
